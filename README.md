# React Bit Form

> An ultra-powerful, zero-dependency form generator for building dynamic and complex forms in React

## Overview

**React Bit Form** is a lightweight yet incredibly powerful form generation library built with pure React‚Äîno external dependencies for validation or form management. Whether you're building simple contact forms or managing enterprise-level multi-section forms with complex interdependencies, React Bit Form handles it all with elegance and efficiency.

## Why React Bit Form?

Most form libraries force you to choose between simplicity and power. React Bit Form gives you both. Built from the ground up to handle the most complex form scenarios while remaining intuitive for everyday use cases.

### The Power of Pure React

- **Zero Dependencies**: Built entirely with vanilla React‚Äîno bloated validation libraries or form management packages
- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size without compromising on features
- **Framework Agnostic Styling**: Use Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, or any styling solution you prefer

## Key Features

### üéØ Intelligent Validation Engine

At the heart of React Bit Form is the **validatorEngine**‚Äîa sophisticated internal engine that handles professional-grade validations without writing a single line of validation code. Set up complex validation rules declaratively and let the engine do the heavy lifting.

### üîó Advanced Field Relationships

Create complex interdependencies between fields with ease:

- **Conditional Resets**: Automatically reset field values or errors based on other field changes
- **Dynamic Visibility**: Show/hide fields based on form state
- **Conditional Enabling**: Enable/disable fields dynamically
- **Cross-Field Validation**: Validate fields based on relationships with other fields

### üìã Multi-Section Forms

Build complex forms with multiple sections, each with its own logic:

- Independent section validation
- Section-specific submit buttons
- Section-level error handling
- Granular control over which fields to validate on submission

### üé® Complete Styling Freedom

No opinionated styles‚Äîbring your own design:

- Full control over form appearance
- Seamless Tailwind CSS integration
- Custom component rendering
- Responsive design support

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Data Management

- **Default Values**: Pre-populate forms with initial data
- **Auto-Fetch**: Configure forms to automatically fetch initial values from API endpoints
- **Conditional Options**: Dynamically populate select/dropdown options based on other field values
- **API-Driven Options**: Fetch field options from endpoints with dynamic query parameters
- **Option Filtering**: Filter available options based on form state

### üéØ Flexible Validation Control

Fine-grained control over what gets validated and when:

- Choose which fields to validate on submission
- Skip validation for specific fields
- Set errors on forms, sections, or individual fields
- Global error handling

### üöÄ Zero-Code Form Building

The ultimate developer experience:

- **JSON-Driven**: Entire forms defined by JSON configuration
- **Backend-Ready**: JSON can come from anywhere‚ÄîAPI, database, config files
- **Visual Builder**: Includes a drag-and-drop UI builder for creating forms without writing JSON
- **Rapid Development**: Build complex forms in minutes, not hours

## Perfect For

- Multi-step wizards with complex validation
- Admin panels with dynamic form requirements
- Enterprise applications with intricate business logic
- Forms that need to adapt based on user input
- Any scenario where form fields have complex relationships
